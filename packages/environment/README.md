# @neat-evolution/environment

Types for the environment. Environments provide the training data and also evaluates the fitness of an organism.

There's nothing to see here. The default environment is the `@neat-evolution/dataset-environment` adapted from the original Rust implementation.

```sh
yarn add @neat-evolution/environment
```
