# @neat-js/reproducer

Code for managing the reproduction of Organisms in Web Workers (or Node Worker Threads). As  number of nodes and links in a network grows, the time it takes to reproduce a population of Organisms grows linearly. This package allows for the reproduction of Organisms to be done in parallel, which should offer a significant performance improvement.

```sh
yarn add @neat-js/reproducer
```
